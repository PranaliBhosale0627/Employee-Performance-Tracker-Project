# Employee-Performance-Tracker-Project

### Project Overview

The Employee Performance Tracker is a Python-based system designed to manage and analyze employee performance data in an IT company.
It helps track details such as employee name, department, hours worked, tasks completed, and performance rating.
The project demonstrates practical applications of OOP, File Handling, Functions, and Data Visualization concepts from Python Phase 1.

### Objectives

Store and manage employee data using CSV files.

Analyze performance and identify top performers.

Visualize productivity using charts.

Implement OOP principles and modular programming.

Provide a simple, interactive console interface.
